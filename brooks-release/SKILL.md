  Cut a brooks-lint release: set the version in package.json, propagate it across
  all four plugin manifests + README badge, write the CHANGELOG entry, validate,
  then commit, push, tag, and publish the GitHub release.
  Triggers when the maintainer asks to "release", "cut a release", "ship a new
  version", or "bump and publish" brooks-lint.
  Do NOT trigger for: propagating an already-decided version without releasing
  (use `npm run bump` directly), CHANGELOG edits alone, or questions about the
  release process that don't ask to perform it.

# brooks-lint — Release

Target version comes from `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. `1.4.0`). If empty, ask the maintainer
for the semver bump before doing anything.

Execute these steps in order. `bump-version.mjs` reads the version FROM
`package.json` and does NOT touch the changelog — so the version edit and the
CHANGELOG entry are manual; the script only fans the version out to manifests + badge.

1. **Set the source of truth.** `npm version <version> --no-git-tag-version`
   (the `--no-git-tag-version` flag is required — plain `npm version` would create
   its own commit + tag and collide with the manual commit in step 5).
2. **Propagate.** `npm run bump` — writes the version into
   `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`,
   `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `gemini-extension.json`, and the README badge.
3. **Write the changelog.** Add a new `## <version>` section at the top of
   `CHANGELOG.md` with categorized notes (Added / Fixed / Changed) summarizing the
   commits since the last release tag (`git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline`).
4. **Validate.** `npm run validate` — fails if any manifest, the README badge, or
   the CHANGELOG entry is out of sync. Fix and re-run until clean. Then `npm test`.
5. **Commit & push.** Stage the changed manifests, README, and CHANGELOG; commit
   with a conventional message (`chore(release): bump version to <version>`); push
   to `main` (direct-to-main repo — no PR).
6. **Tag & publish.** Create the GitHub release:
   `gh release create v<version> --title "v<version>" --notes "<changelog section>"`.

Report the released version and the GitHub release URL when done.
